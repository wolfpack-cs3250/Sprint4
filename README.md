Sprint 2

Notes:

- Moustache as our templating engine

- CRUD; Create, Read, Update, Delete

- Get -> READ, POST -> Create, DELETE -> Delete, PUT -> Update

- JPA: Java Persistence API (Hibernate)

- ORM:  Classes --> Table
        Instance --> Row
        Variables --> Columns

- Create a user class and be able to do the CRUD ops on it.

- Use apache derby.
